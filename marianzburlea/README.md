# Create a website that uses only HTML.

Building a website using only HTML and not CSS as a challenge enables someone like you to gain an understanding of how effective HTML is at structuring content, how simple it is to build a website with the knowledge of just 10 HTML tags, and how it also has its limitations.

## PRO

The most significant advantage is that you can construct an entire website using only a small number of HTML tags; for instance, in the demonstration given here, I used just ten HTML tags to construct the website.

If you are someone who is just starting out on their path to becoming a web developer, this can give you a lot of confidence and get you ready to work on your first project.

This current project is made easier to maintain and further develop in terms of both its content and its structure as a result of the application of the DRY principle.

# CON

This method has its limitations, so if you want to create more complex websites, you'll need to make use of CSS and JavaScript instead.

When it comes to search engine optimisation, this method is not the most effective one, either (Search Engine Optimization)
